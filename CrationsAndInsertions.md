# Creations and insertions
I'll admit the insertions are generated by ChatGPT since this is just basic, repetitive stuff that would have taken med 10 times longer.
```sql
-- Create tables
CREATE TABLE Film (
    film_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    year INTEGER,
    genre VARCHAR(100),
    score INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE People (
    people_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Director (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    people_id INTEGER REFERENCES People(people_id),
    country VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Writer (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    people_id INTEGER REFERENCES People(people_id),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Star (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    people_id INTEGER REFERENCES People(people_id),
    birthday DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Film_People (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
